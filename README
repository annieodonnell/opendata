### INTRODUCTION

This is a collection of datasets that I've sourced or derived to support my d3 and tableau (public) work. My focus is on the analysis of Scottish healthcare datasets, but I'm generally interested in all kinds of data questions. The datasets made available have been modified for use from the original sources, which are listed below. The data is subject to change as modifications and updates are developed and as new sources are integrated. I'll try to maintain accuracy of the data but if you do find errors please report them via the issue tracker.


### D3 (DATA DRIVEN DOCUMENTS):

"D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation."

### TABLEAU (PUBLIC):

"Tableau Public is a free tool that brings data to life. Easy to use.  Spectacularly powerful. Data In. Brilliance Out."
