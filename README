### INTRODUCTION

This is a collection of data, workbooks, and notes that I've developed to
support my tableau (public) and d3 work. My  focus is on the analysis of
Scottish health care data sets, but I'm generally interested in all kinds of
data questions.

The data made available has been modified for use from the original sources,
which are listed below. I don't make any claims as to the completeness, accuracy
of content of any data contained in this repository. The data is subject to change
as modifications and updates are complete.


### TABLEAU PUBLIC:

"Tableau Public is a free tool that brings data to life. Easy to use. 
Spectacularly powerful. Data In. Brilliance Out."

### D3 (DATA DRIVEN DOCUMENTS):

"D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps
you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards
gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a
proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-
driven approach to DOM manipulation."
