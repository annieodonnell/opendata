### INTRODUCTION

This is a collection of data, workbooks, and notes that I've developed to
support my tablea public work. My  focus is on the analysis of Scottish health
care data sets, but I'm generally interested in all kinds of data  questions.

The data made available has been modified for use from the original sources,
which are listed below. I don't make any claims as to the completeness,
accuracy of content of any data contain in this repository. The data is
subject to change as modifications and updates are complete.


### TABLEAU PUBLIC:

"Tableau Public is a free tool that brings data to life. Easy to use. Spectacularly powerful. Data In. Brilliance Out."
